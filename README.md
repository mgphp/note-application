# Note taking app
I have built this app with React Redux Webpack 2.0 babel kit with, babel, es2015 and sass. I have 
used Jest and Enzyme for testing. 

##Installation

```bash
    $ npm install
```

##Usage

To use webpack dev server & watch,

```bash
    $ npm start
    
    Then listens on http://localhost:3000
    
```

## Technical Choices
```bash
 
  I have created 6 components and the appropriate tests to go with
  each component.
  
  5 of these components are then imported into the app.js file.
  
  I have some additional features like tagging CSV download etc. However this is 100% working at present.
  
  If I had more time in the process I would like to add a more broader range of unit tests and spend more time on 
  the UI.
